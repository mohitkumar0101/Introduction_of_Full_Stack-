         in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country
          as of June 2023;[22][23] and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's
           most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the 
           Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land
            borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and
             Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity
              of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime 
              border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.
